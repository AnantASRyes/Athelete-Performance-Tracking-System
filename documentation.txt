ATHLETE PERFORMANCE TRACKING SYSTEM - DOCUMENTATION

Overview:
This project is designed to track, analyze, and improve athlete performance using simple Python scripts and structured data.

Files Included:
1. main.py          → Runs the project
2. analysis.py      → Contains analysis logic
3. dataset.csv      → Sample data of athlete performance
4. output.txt       → Generated analysis output
5. README.md        → Project description
6. documentation.txt → Technical documentation of the system

Working:
- The system reads data from dataset.csv
- Analysis is performed using analysis.py
- The final output is displayed and saved in output.txt

Future Scope:
- Integrate machine learning models
- Add a web dashboard for coaches
- Enable real-time performance tracking
